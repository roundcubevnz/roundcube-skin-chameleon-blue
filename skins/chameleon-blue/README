Chameleon Kolab Enterprise Roundcube Skin
================================

Chameleon Blue customization of [Chameleon](https://git.kolab.org/diffusion/RSC/), 
also known as Kolab Enterprise Web Client Skin.


## installation

Just copy it content as `chameleonb` directory into your Roundcube instance/skins directory.

**Chameleonb depends on Larr skin installed and name must be "chameleonb".**

## Hacking

styles.css is written using LESS syntax, compiled with `lessc` by `nodejs-less`
but there's better options like https://github.com/codeigniterpower/compiler-lessphp

 $ lessc -x styles.less > styles.css

(the -x option minifies the CSS code)

References to image files from the included CSS files can be appended
with cache-buster marks to avoid browser caching issues after updating.

Run `bin/updatecss.sh --dir <path-to-chameleonb-skin>` from the Roundcube
package before packaging the skin or after installing it on the
destination system.
